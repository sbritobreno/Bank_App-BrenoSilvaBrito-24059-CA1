# BankApp-BrenoSilvaBrito-24059-CA1
In this assessment from college, I have been requested to create a Bank Application, using C#, and windows forms.
Anyone who wants to run this code on their PC should save this repository as "BankApp" on the local disk (C:),
(C:\BankApp), in addition make sure you have a folder called "Accounts" inside the folder "BankApp", otherwise the program won't be able to find files that the program should create.
